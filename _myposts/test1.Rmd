This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
map3 <- Leaflet$new()
map3$setView(c(51.505, -0.09), zoom = 13)
map3$marker(c(51.5, -0.09), bindPopup = "<p> Hi. I am a popup </p>")
map3$marker(c(51.495, -0.083), bindPopup = "<p> Hi. I am another popup </p>")
map3$print('chart7')
```
